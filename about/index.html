Hi there, I'm Nick Dichev! I'm a software engineering living and working in Seattle. <br><br>

Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.peek.com">Peek</a> as a backend developer. My goal for this website is to share things that I find interesting (both technical and non-technical). Some technologies that I'm currently interested in are: distributed systems, computer vision, and machine learning. <br><br>

Some non-technical things that I am interested in include: mechanical keyboards, kiteboarding, and bonsai. <br><br>

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:nickdichev@yahoo.com">email</a> or interact with me on <a href="https://github.com/nickdichev">Github</a>!
