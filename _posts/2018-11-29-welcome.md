Well, its happening, another software engineer is starting another blog. 

I'll be mostly writing about technology that I am interested in, however, there may be some posts that are non-technical. Some of the technical blog posts I have planned are:

* Analyzing Docker images with [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive)
* How to clean a `git` repository with [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)
* How to implement a SMTP proxy with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

I am currently drafting these blogs, be sure to check back in for updates! Thanks for looking!
